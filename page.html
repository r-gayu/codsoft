        <p>ITC Hotels
            Enabling authentic indigenous experiences in harmony with environment & society
            Each ITC Hotel is an archetype of the culture and ethos of the region that it is located in. The concept of each of the hotels weaves in the strongest elements of the culture of the region – harking back through architecture, interiors, art and artefacts to the major dynasties who have ruled India.
            
            The unique value propositions, including the differentiated character of hotels, coupled with indigenous experiences is what makes every ITC Hotel unique.
            India’s centuries-rooted sacred relationship with its environment, of sustenance and nurture, is a vital and living heritage that is the cornerstone of the ITC Hotels ethos and an affirmation of Responsible Luxury: luxury without compromising the earth and sustainability without compromising luxury. 
            Responsible Luxury is the effective combination of luxury and responsible practices (enriching society and the environment) so that the luxury experiences delivered at ITC Hotels do not in any way burden the environment or the society around us. In fact, it is aimed at creating a positive impact on both the community-at-large and the environment.</p>
